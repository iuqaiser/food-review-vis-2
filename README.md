# Visualizing the Vector Embeddings of Food Reviews
This project aimed to visualize vector embeddings using Plotly and Streamlit, and allows users to search for terms within the dataset, which are then matched by calculating the Euclidean distances between the user query and each entry in the dataset.

## Ongoing issues:
- inaccurate similarity scores
